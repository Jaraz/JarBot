Try to write down explcit findings

General ideas: 
I think collecting stop should be a function of average halite in map
	-Low halite maps should collect more per square than high halite maps

Game Size / Players
32 / 2p: I suspect that collecting stop should be smaller


Default parametsrs
shipBuildingTurns = 175
collectingStop    = 50 # Ignore halite less than this
returnFlagRatio   = 1 # higher means it returns earlier, ratio to 1000
MAX_DEPO          = 1
DEPO_HALITE_LOOK  = 5
DEPO_HALITE       = 125

for 60+
ShipBuidingTurns = 250
RADAR_MAX = 12
DEPO_HALITE + 25

For 50+:
ShipBuidingTurns = 225

For 40+:
ShipBuidingTurns = 200
